# Paradise Explorer

Simple ICIJ Paradise Papers explorer powered by a Neo4J graph database, (an eventual) GraphQL server/data gateway, and a SvelteKit + d3.js visualizer frontend.
Everything WIPâ€¦ for the forseeable future.

## Data
[`paradise-explorer-data`](https://github.com/alphahw/paradise-explorer-data)

- Raw CSV sources
- Cleanup and GraphQL type definition generation scripts (written in node.js)
- Database dump(s)

## Data server/gateway
[`paradise-explorer-server`](https://github.com/alphahw/paradise-explorer-server)

Very simple GraphQL server/gateway to Neo4J.

## Frontend
[`paradise-explorer-fe`](https://github.com/alphahw/paradise-explorer-fe)

SvelteKit-based FE app with visualizations using d3.js. Currently reads data directly from a Neo4J database using the Neo4J JS driver, but one day hopefully powered by GraphQL.
